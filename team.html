              Robert Reffkin is an entrepreneur on a mission to help everyone
              find their place in the world. He was inspired to enter the world
              of real estate by his mother, Ruth, a longtime agent who now
              proudly works at Compass. Robert completed a B.A. and M.B.A. from
              Columbia University and worked at McKinsey, Goldman Sachs, and as
              a White House Fellow. He ran 50 marathons in 50 states to raise $1
              million dollars for charities — including for America Needs You,
              the non-profit he founded to serve young people living below the
              poverty line who are the first in their families to go to college.
              He is donating all of his proceeds from his new book, No One
              Succeeds Alone, to nonprofits that help young people realize their
              dreams
